 For
 each
 of the following
 scenarios,
 use a supply and demand diagram
 to illustrate the  of the given
 shock
 on the equilibrium price and quantity
 in the sp
 competitive
 market.
 Explain whether there is a shift in the demand curve,
 the supply curve,
 or neither. (a) (5 points)
 An unexpected
 temporary
 heat wave
 hits the East Coast. Show
 the ect
 in the ice cream market
 in New England.The temporary
 heat wave
 shifts
 the demand curve
 to the right
 from D to D0 . As a result,equilibrium price and quantity
 both
 go up.(b) (5 points)
 The government
 introduces
 a tax on ice cream which
 is paid by
 producers.
 What is the  in the ice cream
 market?
The supply curve
 shifts up from S to S0 by
 the amount
 of the tax. As a result, the equilibriumprice increases and the equilibrium
 quantity
 decreases. However,
 the rise in the equilibrium pricefrom P to P 0 is smaller than the tax.(c) (5 points)
 China and Mexico are major
 producers
 of textiles. Workers
 in Mexico decide to go on strike.
 Show
 the e
 on the market
 for Mexican textiles.The supply curve
 for Mexican textiles shifts to the left. This results in a higher equilibrium priceand lower
 equilibrium quantity
 in the market
 for Mexican textiles.(d) (5 points)
 Show
 the t
 of the situation
 described
 in (c) on the market
 for Chinese textiles. The demand curve
 for Chinese textiles shifts to the right.
 This results in a higher equilibrium
 price and higher
 equilibrium quantity
 in the market
 for Chinese textiles.

 Suppose
 the government
 imposes
 a price cap on bottled
 water.
Show
 the  in the bottled
 water
 market.
 1 If the price ceiling P  is set
 below
 the equilibrium
 price P , then there will be
 a shortage of bottled
 water
 in the amount
 of Q1  Q2 and bottled
 water
 will be
 rationed.
 If the price ceiling is above
 the equilibrium price, then there is no  Problem 1 solution courtesy of William

 For
 each
 of the following
 pairs of goods,
 identify
 which
 one you
 would
 expect
 to have
 more own-price
 elastic demand. Please explain your
 reasoning.
 (a) (5 points)
 Computers (generally) vs. Apple MacBook
 Pro laptops.Apple MacBook
 Pro, because
 it is a sp
 brand and has
 more substitutability.
(b) (5 points)
 Stereo
 headphones (generally) vs. hearing aids.Stereo headphones, since they tend to be
 less of a necessity
 good
 than hearing aids.For
 each
 of the
 following
 goods,
 identify
 whether you
 would
 expect
 demand to be
 more (own-price)
 elastic in the short run or the long run. As above,
 please  explain your
 reasoning. (c) (5 points)
 Retail gasoline in the suburbs of Chicago. More price elastic in the long run, because
 people
 cannot ely
 adjust to necessity
 goods
 like
 gasoline in the short run,
 while in the long run, people
 can substitute it with electricity
 (hybrid
 cars), diesel, public transportation,
 etc. (d) (5 points)
 Air conditioning units in Miami
 Beach,
 Florida. More price elastic in the short
 run, because
 there are other good
 substitutes in the short run, such
 as fans. If there
 were
 a sudden increase in the price of A/C units, people
 could delay
 their purchase
 of a unit for a few days
 or weeks.
 But in the long run, there is no good
 substitute for A/C. Problem 2 solution courtesy of Luke

 Consider the market
 for apple juice.In this
 market,
 the supply curve
 is given
 by
 QS = 10PJ  5PA and the demand curve
 is given
 by
 QD = 100  15PJ + 10PT , where J denotes apple juice, A denotes apples, and T denotes tea. (a) (7 points)
 Assume
 that PA is  at $1 and PT = 5. Calculate the equilibrium price and quantity
 in the apple
 juice market.
We
 have
 the system of equations Q = 10PJ  5  1 and Q = 100  15PJ + 10  5. Solving for PJand Q we
 get that PJ =6
:2 and Q = 57.(b) (7 points)
 Suppose
 that a poor
 harvest
 season raises the price of apples to PA = 2. Find the new equilibrium price and quantity
 of apple juice. Draw
 a graph to illustrate your
 answer.
 2 We
 now
 have
 to solve
 the system: Q = 10PJ  10Q = 150  15PJSolving for PJ and Q we
 get that PJ =6
:4 and Q = 54. In a supply
 and demand graph, the supplycurve
 shifts
 to the left,
 resulting in the higher equilibrium price and lower
 equilibrium
 quantity.
(c) (8 points)
 Suppose
 PA = 1 but the price
 of tea drops to PT = 3. Find the new equilibrium
 price and quantity
 of apple juice.Q = 10PJ  5, Q = 130  15PJ !
 PJ =5
:4, Q = 49.(d) (8 points)
 Suppose
 PA =1
;P
T = 5, and there is a price ceiling on apple juice of P  = 5. What is J the excess demand for apple juice as a result? Draw
 a graph to illustrate your
 answer.
Note that the price ceiling will be
 binding,
 since the equilibrium price from (a) is PJ =6
:2.Plugging the price
 ceiling level
 into
 the supply and demand equations we
 get that QS = 45 andQD = 75. Hence, there will be
 excess demand for apple juice of QE = 30. The graph in Question
1(e) shows
 the identical
 case as the one here.Problem 3 solution courtesy of William

 You
 have
 been
 asked
 to analyze the market
 for steel.
 From
 public sources, you
 are able to  that last
 year's
 price for steel was
 $20 per
 ton. At
 this price, 100 million tons were
 sold on the world
 market.
 From
 trade association
 data you
 are able to obtain
 estimates for the own-price
 elasticities of demand and supply on the world
 markets
 as 0:25 for demand and 0:5 for supply.
 Assume that steel has linear demand and supply curves
 throughout. (a) (10 points)
 Solve
 for the equations of demand and supply
 in this market
 and sketch
 the demand and supply curves.
Assume that this is a competitive
 market
 and assume that demand and supply are linear. Thus,
Xd = a  bP and Xs = c + dP . We
 know
 from the equation for own-price
 elasticity
 of demandthatdXd PX PX 20 EQX PX ==
 b = b = 0:25 dPX Xd Xd 100 Solving for b, then, we
 have
 b =1
:25. Substituting
 back
 into
 the equation
 for demand, Xd = a  1:25P or 100 = a  1:25(20). Solving for a we
 have
 a = 125. Hence, the equation for last year's
 demand is Xd = 125  1:25P . We
 know
 that
 the price elasticity
 of supply is dXs PX 20 EQX PX ==
 d =0
:5 dPX Xs 100 3 Solving for d, then, we
 have
 d =2
:5. Substituting back
 into
 the equation for supply,
 Xs = c+2
:5P or 100=
 c +2
:5(20). Solving for c, we
 have
 c = 50. Hence, the equation for last year's
 supply is Xs = 50+2
:5P . (b) (15 points)
 Suppose
 that you
 discover
 that the current
 price of steel
 is $15 per
 ton and the current
 level
 of worldwide
 sales of steel is 150 million tons. The most recent
 elasticity
 estimates
 from the trade association
 this year
 are 0:125 for demand and 0:25 for supply.
 Describe
 the change
 in the supply and
 demand curves
 over
 the past year
 using your
 diagram from part (a). What sort of event(s)
 might
 explain the change?
 Using the same functional
 forms as in the  part of the answer,
 with the new data we
  that Xd = a  bP becomes
 150 = a  b(15). Our equation for elasticity
 of demand yields dXd PX PX 15 EQX PX ==
 b = b = 0:125 dPX Xd Xd 150 Solving for b yields b =1
:25. Substituting
 this value
 for b into
 the equation for (linear) demand,we
 have
 150 = a  1:25(15) or a = 168:75. Hence,
 Xd = 168:75  1:25P .For
 supply,
 we
 have
 Xs = c + dP or 150=
 c + d(15). The equation for elasticity
 yieldsdXs PX 15 EQX PX ==
 d =0
:25 dPX Xs 150 Solving for
 d yields d =2
:5. Substituting this value
 for d into
 the equation
 for linear supply,
 we
 have
 150 = c +2
:5(15) or c = 112:5. Thus,
 Xs = 112:5+2
:5P . The demand and
 supply have
 kept
 the same slope
 as last year,
 but the intercepts
 have
 changed
 for both
 curves:
 demand and supply have
 shifted out. The demand shift
 could occur
 with any
 number
 of factors that increase the willingness to pay
 for steel at any
 given
 price, such
 as an increase in income, an increase in the price of other
 (substitute) materials, or the increase in demand for a good
 that requires steel as an input, like
 cars. The supply shift could occur
 with any
 of a number
 of factors
 that increase
 the willingness to produce
 steel for the markets
 at a given
 price, such
 as an increase in the number
 of
  that sell steel, or a decrease in the prices
 of inputs required to produce
 steel (such
 as steel
 workers'
 wages).
